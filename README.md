##### DEVIATIONS
 - to come

##### POINTS OF NOTE
- Cooincidently this assignment was similar to a section in an online Udemy React/Redux course I worked on a couple years ago; and I was able to reuse the same API key.

##### OUTSTANDING ITEMS
- I am not usually capturing people's location through the browser and perhaps it's a sign of the times but this task is not as easy as it once was without an SSL certificate. You will have to pull down the code and run the site locally to see the location feature at work.
- After reading the technical test summary I had envisioned what I eventually built.... except for the choppy background image transitions, so that is something that needs work (if you revist a city, then your browser has the image cached and the transition is nice and smooth, as it was intended)
- There is also no real error handling outside of a couple state variables - tsk, tsk.


Thanks for your time reviewing what I've brought to the table o[''/]o
